# Find-Factorial-Of-Number-With-Notepad
You can make a program that can calculate a **Factorial** for you. Many of you already know the **syntax** or way to calculate Factorial with pen and paper. This is the same method we have to **implement in the program**.

# FIND FACTORIAL OF NUMBER WITH NOTEPAD
The logic to **find a factorial of a number** is very easy. As factorial is the **simple multiplication** of numbers, So it doesn’t matter whether you multiply them in **increasing** order or in **decreasing** order – the result remains the same. (I’m using simply a For loop here), which goes to the specified number and multiply all numbers coming in-between.

```
Fact(5) = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120 (Traditional Method)
Fact(5) = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120 (Same Result)
```
#  HOW DOES IT WORK? – PRINT FACTORIAL OF A NUMBER
You can print the **Factorial** of any number you want to know, but as CMD has its own limitations – and there is the limit of an integer **variable in CMD**. (which holds the value of result calculated) As in the above image, we have simply **printed the factorial** of ‘5’ on the **cmd console**.

![Limit of ‘n’ is 31](https://i1.wp.com/www.thebateam.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/23-2-1.png?w=669&ssl=1)

So, we can only print factorial of the **first 31 natural numbers**!! This is only due to the **limitation of CMD** variable length. But, we can still make it improved by using various techniques to boost the limit of variables. But, we can leave that for the next version maybe.
